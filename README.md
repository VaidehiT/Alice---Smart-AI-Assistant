# Alice - Smart AI Assistant

Alice is a voice-activated, intelligent desktop assistant built in Python. Inspired by JARVIS, Alice can understand natural language commands, respond using speech, perform web searches, tell the weather, manage tasks, and interact with your system — all hands-free.

⚠️ Work in Progress: More features and commands will be added over time.
